# MIMic trial – 16S rRNA gene sequencing of FMT donor and patient fecal samples
This repository contains the R scripts used for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data derived from participants in the MIMic trial ([NCT03772899](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03772899)) - a multicenter single-arm phase I safety trial that assessed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma who were being treated with first-line anti-PD-1 therapy.
