# MIMic trial – 16S rRNA gene sequencing of FMT donor and patient fecal samples
This repository contains the R scripts used for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data derived from participants in the MIMic trial (NCT03772899) - a multicenter single-arm phase I safety trial that assessed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma who were being treated with first-line anti-PD-1 therapy. 

### R Markdown walk-through
See [here](https://bdaisley.github.io/MIMic-trial/16S_analysis_markdown.html) for the R markdown walk-through on generating figures from the 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset. This documents aims to guide the reader through every step of the analysis accomplished in the study and allow for reproducibility.
